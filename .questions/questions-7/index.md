# Predict => Run => Observe => Explain

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctr + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

In this task, you'll need to look at some code in `7.js` and, firstly, predict what it will do, **without executing it**.

{I don't know, can const "name = something" be a function ??
   maybe answer is currentYear(2023) but I don't think anything will happen }

Afterwards, you can execute the code in `7.js` to check your answer üìù
